    <h1>Chaliapin Steak Don</h1>
    <img src="images/steak.png" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The dish is exclusively made by S≈çma combined with the Japanese original
      dish, the <em>Chaliapin</em> Steak and the donburi concept for his first
      <em>Shokugeki</em>. Although the dish was made with cheap ingredients that
      can be found in a supermarket, the dish focused on both innovation and
      balance of the ingredients to fulfill the <em> donburi</em> mantra, "Dons
      are completed in one bowl."
    </p>

      <li>Beef Sirloin (Supermarket discount)</li>
      <li>Lots of Onion</li>
      <li>Garlic (mix with onion)</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Potato Starch</li>
      <li>Rice (Donburi Bowl)</li>
      <li>Umeboshi Paste</li>
      <li>Pickled Plum</li>
      <li>Sauce</li>
      <ul>

        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Chop the onions finely.</li>
      <li>
        Remove the tendons from the beef and beat it with a meat tenderizer
        until as flat as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover meat on both sides with the chopped onion and leave for 30 minutes
        or more. Remove the onion and add salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the steak to your preference(most would prefer medium-rare). Remove
        from heat and melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan and fry the
        onion used for the beef until it changes color. Adjust the flavor with
        salt and pepper, then move the onion to the steak.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt the remaining butter in the frying pan and fry the sides of the
        meat before taking it out.
      </li>
      <li>Making the Sauce:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Add red wine to the frying pan used for the beef to deglaze it. Boil
          down the wine while scraping off the meat juice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add soy sauce and mix with everything. Adjust seasonings to personal
          preferences.
        </li>
        <li>Thicken with dissolved potato starch.</li>
      </ol>
