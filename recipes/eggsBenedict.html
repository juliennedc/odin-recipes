    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Dubbed <em>The Queen of Breakfast</em>, this dish is a beautiful gem
      amongst the rubble of other egg dishes. Cooked to perfection by the
      tried-and-true classic recipe, Erina added a secret weapon to it: Karasumi
      powder to further enhance the egg theme. One bite will instinctively cause
      servility to Erina.
